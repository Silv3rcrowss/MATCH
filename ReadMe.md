Whether dealing with large volumes of resumes or searching for the ideal candidate for a niche mission, üîç MATCH optimizes the selection process, enabling sales representatives to focus more on building relationships and closing deals.

## Project Structure

The üîç MATCH project is structured into three core components:

1. **cv_assistant.py**: This is the heart of the application, where the Streamlit interface is set up. It handles user interactions, displays the conversation history, and manages the application's state using Streamlit's session state.

2. **common.py**: Contains utility functions and classes that are utilized across the application. This includes AWS service interactions, file operations, and a custom event handler for the assistant stream.

3. **personal_assitant.py**: Manages the interaction with the OpenAI API. It includes classes for creating and managing conversations, as well as for managing assistants and vector stores.
